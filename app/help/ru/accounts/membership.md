# Подписки

Аккаунты в BitShares разделены на три группы. Мы решили дать пользователям возможность по желанию обновлять свои аккаунты до подобного VIP статуса, чтобы получать выгоду от сниженных комиссий и дополнительных функций.

## Пожизненная подписка

Lifetime Members get a percentage cashback on every transaction fee they pay and income from referrals. A Lifetime membership is associated with a certain one-time fee defined in this [schedule](/explorer/fees).

## Annual Members

If a lifetime membership is too much you can still get the same cashback for the next year by becoming an annual subscriber for a smaller one-time fee which lasts for only one year.

### Fee Division

Every time an account you referred pays a transaction fee, that fee is divided among several different accounts. The network takes a cut, and the Lifetime Member who referred the account gets a cut.

The registrar is the account that paid the transaction fee to register the account with the network. The registrar gets to decide how to divide the remaining fee between themselves and their own affiliate.

### Pending Fees

Fees paid are only divided among the network, referrers, and registrars once every maintenance interval.

### Vesting Fees

Most fees are made available immediately, but fees over the vesting threshold (such as those paid to upgrade your membership or register a premium account name) must vest for some period of time as defined by the committee.
